Need to make this modular

Excel reading and making JSON.

Making the final string.

Writing the data to a file. 


Things that can cause errors.

Wrong file type opened = Write a check function for this. See code below (this is using mutler)
USED TRY/CATCH FOR THIS
// Array of allowed files
const array_of_allowed_files = ['png', 'jpeg', 'jpg', 'gif'];

// Get the extension of the uploaded file
const file_extension = image.originalname.slice(
    ((image.originalname.lastIndexOf('.') - 1) >>> 0) + 2
);

// Check if the uploaded file is allowed
if (!array_of_allowed_files.includes(file_extension)) {
  throw Error('Invalid file');
}

Headers are changed in the xlsx file.

Written a function for this.
Try and catch works for this as well.
